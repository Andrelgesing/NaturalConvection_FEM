The python scripts are partially filled, the general structure of the files is the following

loadParam.py: 
 - class in which the parameters are defined (Rayleigh,Prandtl,Number of nodes on the side before refinement ...)
 - Boundary conditions for 
   1) Navier-Stokes (non zero temperature)
   2) the linearized Navier-Stokes
   both BC need to be implemented
   
myDriver.py:
Many functions are defined here.
The functions that you need to implement are

generate_mesh
refine_mesh_close_to_borders

Jacobian_variational_form
NavierStokes
solve_newton_step
solve_newton

solveEigenvalueProblem

There are some other tool functions you may want to use/modify ...
plot_streamlines_and_isotemperature
